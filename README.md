This is my personal Vim configuration and its associated plugins. If you would like to make use of it, feel free to clone:

	git clone git://github.com/cgioia/vimrc.git

Afterwards, don't forget to pull in the submodules:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

The submodules can be updated with the `bundleup.sh` script.

I have—shall we say—_borrowed_ quite liberally from both [Vincent Driessen][nvie] and Steve Losh[sjl] to get everything where it is. So, credit where credit is due.
