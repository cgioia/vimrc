This is my personal Vim configuration and its associated scripts. If you would like to make use of it, feel free to clone:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/cgioia/vimrc.git

Once cloning is complete, create some symbolic links in your home directory to get vim pointed at the right files:

	ln -s vimrc/vimrc ~/.vimrc
	ln -s vimrc/vim/ ~/.vim
