This is my personal Vim configuration and its associated scripts. If you would like to make use of it, feel free to clone:

	git clone git://github.com/cgioia/vimrc.git

All of the scripts I use are actually git submodules, and you'll need to clone them too:

	cd vimrc
	git submodule update --init

The submodules can be updated to their latest versions with the `bundleup.sh` script.

I have—shall we say—_borrowed_ quite liberally from both [Vincent Driessen][nvie] and [Steve Losh][sjl] to get everything where it is. So, credit where credit is due.
